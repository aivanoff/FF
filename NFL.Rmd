library(nflscrapR)
season_2016 = season_play_by_play(2016)
```

```{r}

## Convert data into usable format 

```{r}
clean = function(df) {
  df$TwoPointConv[df$TwoPointConv != "Success" | is.na(df$TwoPointConv)] = 0
  df$TwoPointConv[df$TwoPointConv == "Success"] = 1
  df$TwoPointConv = as.numeric(df$TwoPointConv)
  return(df)
}
```

## Creating scoring functions
```{r}
points = function(df) {
  df$QBScore = df$PassAttempt * (df$Touchdown * 4 + df$ydsnet * 0.04) + 
    df$RushAttempt * (df$Touchdown * 6 + df$ydsnet * 0.1) + 
    df$InterceptionThrown * (-1) + df$TwoPointConv * 2

  df$FScore = df$Touchdown * 6 + df$ydsnet * 0.1 + df$Reception * 0.5 + df$TwoPointConv * 2
  return(df)
}

```
